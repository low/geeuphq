			<h2>Conference</h2>
			<p class="strong">
				Friday, <strong>27 May</strong> at Scheltema
			</p>
			<p>8:30 &ndash; registration in the foyer.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<img src="./images/2016/speakers/low.jpg" alt="" data-twitter="low" /> 9:20 &ndash;
				<strong>Lodewijk “Low” Schutte</strong>, your friendly neighbourhood conference organiser,
				welcomes you to the conference with some opening remarks.
			</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<img src="./images/2016/speakers/vasilis.jpg" alt="" data-twitter="vasilis" /> 9:30 &ndash;
				The web is weird. We don't know what size the browser of our visitors will be, and we don’t know how they will control our work. This requires a flexible kind of thinking, which seems to be unnatural for many designers. In <em>“Do We Have to Reinvent the Wheel?”</em>, <strong>Vasilis van Gemert</strong> will take a look at some other disciplines that have been working with flexible canvases or unclear environments, to see if we can learn some things from them.
			</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<img src="./images/2016/speakers/anke.jpg" alt="" data-twitter="ankedesign" /> 10:15 &ndash;
				How can you keep your universe from collapsing when the client starts writing their first long line of copy in your carefully crafted site? <strong>Anke Willems</strong>, designer and front-end developer at Two Kings, is very concerned about good interface design. In her talk, she will give practical examples on some of the inevitabilities of working on a responsive site with developers, CMSes, clients and—of course—your own ego.
			</p>
			<p>11:00 &ndash; break.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<img src="./images/2016/speakers/stephen.jpg" alt="" data-twitter="monooso" /> 11:30 &ndash;
				We all need to earn money to keep the lights on, but that doesn't mean you should just accept whatever work comes your way. In <em>“Do The Right Thing”</em>, <strong>Stephen Lewis</strong> discusses some of the tricky questions that arise when deciding whether to take the money or run, and valiantly attempts to explain why he built an “adult entertainment” website, but regularly sends Christians packing.
			</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<img src="./images/2016/speakers/sieger.jpg" alt="" data-twitter="wesseladvies" /> 12:15 &ndash;
				Do you own the code you write? Can you be held accountable for any bugs in open source software? Just how effective is a copyright notice? <strong>Sieger Suurbier</strong>, founder of legal advice agency Wessel, will explain the ins and outs of intellectual property, liability and privacy on the web, so you know exactly in how much (or how little) trouble you are next time you forget to add cookie consent to a site.
			</p>
			<p>13:00 &ndash; buffet lunch provided in the Ketelhuis.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<img src="./images/2016/speakers/kevin.jpg" alt="" data-twitter="kevincupp" /> 14:00 &ndash;
				Adding features or making changes to a site build or add-on can cause anxiety. What if you break something and cause a bug? <strong>Kevin Cupp</strong>, software engineer at EllisLab, will talk about automated testing to show you how you can know right away if your new changes are safe to ship, so you can ship confidently and quickly.
			</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<img src="./images/2016/speakers/denise.jpg" alt="" data-twitter="denisepires" /> 14:45 &ndash;
				Want to offer service with a smile? Eager to make a succes of your product? The key is simple: a deep understanding of your customer. Guerrilla user testing methods provide an accessible way to implement user research for your project. Even better, they allow you to keep testing throughout your project – saving time and money. So, how does this approach work? What do you need to consider? In <em>“The Art of Guerrilla User Testing”</em>, <strong>Denise Pires</strong> will share her experiences and advice to help you turn your project into your next success.
			</p>
			<p>15:30 &ndash; break.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<img src="./images/2016/speakers/michael.jpg" alt="" data-twitter="michaelrog" /> 16:00 &ndash;
				In business, we have a pretty good framework for understanding the value we get in exchange for taking on different kinds of debts or making various investments. Shouldn't we be able to apply a similar framework for understanding <em>technical</em> debt and <em>technical</em> investment? <strong>Michael Rog</strong>, veteran web developer and proprietor of Top Shelf Craft, thinks so. By learning to talk about technical debt in business terms, we'll grow wiser in choosing strategies for our projects <em>and</em> more effective in communicating with our clients and peers.
			</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<img src="./images/2016/speakers/brad.jpg" alt="" data-twitter="angrybrad" /> 16:45 &ndash;
				Left unchecked, supporting the software and services you’ve created and sell can crush your soul, destroy your business, bring about financial ruin and leave you an empty shell of a human being, no matter if you’re a developer, a designer or a business owner. In <em>“How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love Support”</em>, <strong>Brad Bell</strong>, chief mixologist at Pixel &amp; Tonic, takes a look at strategies for how you can prevent this from happening.
			</p>
			<p>
				17:30 &ndash; 19:30, <strong>After-party</strong>: enjoy a drink and snack in the Theatercafé.
			</p>
			<p>
				The schedule is approximate and subject to change.
